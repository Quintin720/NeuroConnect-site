      <h3>ðŸ¦‹ First Post: Why I Created NeuroConnect</h3>
      <p><em>Published: 18-04-2025</em></p>
      <p>After my diagnosis in my mid-forties, everything changed! Not because I became someone new, but because I finally understood who I had always been. NeuroConnect was born from that moment: a space to feel seen, understood, and supported. This blog is where Iâ€™ll be sharing more of that story, and hopefully helping you feel a little less alone.</p>
