After my diagnosis in my mid-forties, everything changed. Not because I became someone new, but because I finally understood who I had always been. NeuroConnect was born from that moment: a space to feel seen, understood, and supported.

This blog is where Iâ€™ll be sharing more of that story, and hopefully helping you feel a little less alone.
