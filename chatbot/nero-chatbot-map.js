  "Explain autism in simple terms.": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental difference that can impact how a person experiences and interacts with the world. It can influence communication, social interaction, sensory processing, and thinking styles. It’s not a disorder to be fixed, but a different way of being with both strengths and challenges.",
  "What are some common strengths of Autistic people?": "Autistic people often bring deep focus, honesty, creativity, strong pattern recognition, and innovative thinking. Many excel in fields like data analysis, design, writing, technology, and care roles. Their strengths flourish when supported and understood.",
  "How does autism present differently in women?": "Autistic women often mask or camouflage their traits, making diagnosis harder. They may appear highly social or empathetic, but this is often learned behaviour. Many internalise stress, leading to anxiety, burnout, or late diagnosis. Awareness of these differences is key to support.",
  "What is the difference between high support needs and low support needs in autism?": "Support needs vary across individuals and environments. Someone may need significant help with daily tasks or communication, while another may appear independent but need support with sensory input or executive functioning. There is no strict line — needs can and do shift over time.",
  "What are some myths about autism that need to be debunked?": "Common myths include that Autistic people lack empathy (they often feel deeply), can’t work in teams (many do with the right conditions), or are all the same (autism is highly individual). These misconceptions can be harmful and prevent inclusion.",
  "What workplace accommodations help Autistic employees thrive?": "Key accommodations include flexible working hours, remote working, clear written instructions, noise reduction tools, permission to use stim aids and comfortable clothing, and regular check-ins. These adjustments support performance and wellbeing.",
  "How can I create an inclusive work environment for Autistic employees?": "Start with education and listening. Ensure policies support neurodivergence, provide accessible communication options, allow sensory breaks, and model inclusive leadership. Foster psychological safety so employees feel they can be themselves.",
  "What are sensory-friendly workplace adjustments?": "These might include quiet workspaces, dimmable lights, headphones, freedom to move, and scent-free zones. Ask the Autistic person what works best for them.",
  "How can managers support Autistic employees effectively?": "Be open, consistent, and understanding. Provide feedback in a calm, clear, and respectful manner. Offer flexibility, avoid assumptions, and prioritise wellbeing as much as performance.",
  "How should I structure performance reviews for an Autistic employee?": "Give written feedback in advance, avoid surprises, and focus on specific outcomes. Allow extra processing time, offer support rather than criticism, and recognise both strengths and areas for growth.",
  "Why should employers hire Autistic employees?": "Autistic employees bring unique, diverse thinking, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail. Inclusion improves team performance, innovation, and workplace culture.",
  "How can businesses benefit from hiring Autistic people?": "You gain loyal, skilled staff with fresh perspectives. Retention improves when people feel valued. Inclusive practices also signal ethical leadership to clients and customers.",
  "How can businesses benefit from supporting and accommodating Autistic people?": "Supporting Autistic employees reduces absenteeism, increases job satisfaction, and cultivates loyalty. When employees feel safe, they do their best work.",
  "What are the biggest barriers Autistic people face in the workplace?": "Barriers include unclear expectations, inaccessible hiring practices, sensory overload, and lack of understanding. These are preventable with education and inclusive policy.",
  "How can I make job interviews more accessible for Autistic candidates?": "Offer questions in writing, allow extra processing time, explain what to expect in advance, reduce sensory stressors, and focus on strengths, not social performance.",
  "What is the best way to provide feedback to an Autistic employee?": "Use specific, non-judgemental language. Avoid sarcasm or vague criticism. Provide it in writing where possible, and allow time for reflection and follow-up.",
  "What are my legal responsibilities when hiring Autistic employees?": "Under equality legislation, employers must consider reasonable accommodations and prevent discrimination. This can include adapting interviews, tasks, and environments to meet individual needs.",
  "How does the law protect Autistic employees in the workplace?": "Autistic employees are protected under disability and equality laws, which mandate inclusive practices and protection from unfair treatment. Failure to follow these laws can result in legal consequences.",
  "What should I do if an Autistic employee discloses their diagnosis?": "Thank them for their trust, ask what support they need, and follow up with reasonable accommodations. Keep information confidential and treat their disclosure with respect.",
  "What are the consequences of failing to provide reasonable accommodations?": "Not providing accommodations may lead to legal action, reduced performance, increased turnover, and harm to workplace culture and company reputation. Being proactive protects your employees and your organisation.",
  "How can I introduce autism training in my company?": "Start with leadership buy-in, then deliver training from Autistic-led, neuroaffirmative providers. Make it part of induction and ongoing professional development.",
  "What are key topics to include in an autism awareness training for employees?": "Cover communication, sensory differences, strengths, accommodations, workplace myths, masking, and inclusive language. Include lived experience and practical examples. Always keep a strengths-based focus.",
  "What are some resources for Autistic job seekers?": "Look into Autistic-led organisations, inclusive recruiters, workplace mentoring schemes, and online communities.",
  "What are common signs of Autistic burnout?": "Exhaustion, withdrawal, shutdowns, sensory sensitivity, emotional distress, or loss of skills. Burnout is real and serious — not laziness."
