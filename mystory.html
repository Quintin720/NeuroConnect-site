      <h2>Hi, I’m the founder of NeuroConnect</h2>
      <p>I was diagnosed as Autistic in my mid-forties. That moment didn’t come with answers, it came with a flood of questions, grief, relief, and realisation. Looking back, I saw a lifetime of masking, misunderstanding, and trying to survive in a world that wasn’t designed with me in mind.</p>

      <p>NeuroConnect was born from that realisation. It’s not just a website, it’s a place I wish I had when I was first navigating my diagnosis. A space that’s honest, empowering, and built on lived experience. I created NeuroConnect to make the journey gentler for others like me, and for those who support us.</p>

      <h2>What I’m Building</h2>
      <p>This platform is designed to connect, inform, and uplift. Through NeuroConnect, I want to help people understand autism from an Autistic perspective, not just a textbook. That means:
        <ul>
          <li>Creating neuroaffirmative training for workplaces and educators</li>
          <li>Offering AI support that’s actually informed by Autistic lived experience</li>
          <li>Writing from the heart through my blog</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>What I Believe</h2>
      <p>Being Autistic isn’t a problem to solve. It’s a different way of experiencing the world. When people are supported, understood, and accepted, they thrive. NeuroConnect is here to help make that happen; one conversation, one connection at a time.</p>
