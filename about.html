      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>NeuroConnect was founded by someone who, like many others, spent a lifetime masking and misreading their own neurodivergence — and was diagnosed Autistic in their mid-forties. That diagnosis didn’t mark the start of something wrong — it marked the beginning of understanding, healing, and empowerment.</p>

      <p>This space was created to provide what was missing for so long: accessible, affirming, and practical support from an Autistic perspective. NeuroConnect exists for Autistic people, those exploring their identity, and the educators, employers, and allies who walk alongside us.</p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🌟 Offer neuroaffirmative training and education</li>
        <li>🧠 Provide AI-powered support from an Autistic-informed lens</li>
        <li>💬 Share lived experiences through our blog</li>
        <li>🤝 Help bridge understanding between Autistic people and their communities</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>We believe being Autistic is not something to fix — it’s something to understand, support, and embrace. Neurodivergence is a strength, not a deficit. At NeuroConnect, we create space where Autistic voices are heard, celebrated, and supported — not just accommodated.</p>
